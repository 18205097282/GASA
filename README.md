# Fine-Grained-Cross-Modal-Retrieval
I propose a method of Fine-Grained Cross-Modal Retrieval based on generative and adversarial network . The main innovations are:(1)Video Noise Frame Removal Based Data Pre-processing(2)Self Attention Based Text Feature Extractor(3) Generative adversarial Network based Adversarial Training.
